# cross-chain-rebase-dashboard
This project is a dashboard for tracking a cross-chain rebase token built with Chainlink CCIP. It uses SQL Server to store dummy or real token data like deposits, rebases, and cross-chain transfers. Power BI is used to create visual reports showing token growth, user activity, and bridging between chains.
